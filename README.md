Shows the big challenge for machine learning technologies

Classifier for detecting digit '0' or '1' from MNIST

**IF the '1' are shifted to the left or the right, then the classifier fails to give the correct answer**

- [Starts with basic CNN] - All shifted '1's are classified as '0's

- [Add to the classifier data sugmentation] - Some shifted '1's are correctly classified

- [Change the model for a transfer learning] - TBD
